# Architecture Update - Node.js/React.js Integration

## Update Summary
Based on user request, the architecture has been updated from a .NET 8 backend to a full-stack JavaScript solution using Node.js and React.js.

## Key Changes

### Backend Changes
- **From**: .NET 8 with C#
- **To**: Node.js with TypeScript and Express.js
- **Rationale**: Unified JavaScript/TypeScript stack for easier full-stack development

### Frontend Addition
- **New**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Components**: Component-based architecture with Redux for state management
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development experience
- **UI Library**: Material-UI or Ant Design for consistent components

### Benefits of JavaScript Stack
1. **Unified Language**: JavaScript/TypeScript across frontend and backend
2. **Shared Code**: Ability to share types, utilities, and validation logic
3. **Large Ecosystem**: Extensive npm package ecosystem
4. **Developer Experience**: Hot reloading, modern tooling
5. **Community Support**: Large community for both Node.js and React.js

### Microsoft Graph Integration
- Uses official Microsoft Graph JavaScript SDK
- MSAL.js for browser authentication
- MSAL Node for server-side authentication
- Same Graph API endpoints and functionality

### Deployment Strategy
- Docker containers for both frontend and backend
- Can deploy to Azure Container Instances or App Service
- Frontend can be served via CDN for better performance
- Backend API can scale independently

## Migration Path from .NET (if applicable)
1. API endpoints remain RESTful - same interface
2. Authentication flow remains OAuth 2.0 with Azure AD
3. Microsoft Graph API calls are functionally identical
4. Business logic can be ported with syntax changes

## Technology Alignment
- Node.js is well-supported for Microsoft Graph API
- React.js provides excellent user experience for booking forms
- TypeScript ensures type safety similar to C#
- Modern JavaScript features provide async/await patterns similar to .NET
