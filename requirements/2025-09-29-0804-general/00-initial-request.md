I would like to create a node.js bookingsystem application. It is based on the fact that a person can be booked by a client to have some kind of meeting. It shall be working together with Microsoft's GraphAPI and specfically the booking system. I would like you to guide me through every step of the setup process, this means telling me what you setup and why you do it in that way. In the root folder of this project there are two files. The Opkald.docx is the task that i have received from my team lead here you can find more context of what is required by me. The insurance-meeting-booking-system-prd 1.md is the requirments set by the customer. We do not need to implement all these user stories right now as what we want right now is a POC. Read them and then lets start the process.
