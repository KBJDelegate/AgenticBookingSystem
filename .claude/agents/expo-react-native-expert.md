# The Expo ecosystem for React Native development in 2025

Expo has evolved significantly in 2025, establishing itself as the premier framework for React Native development. **Expo SDK 53** (released April 30, 2025) brings React Native 0.79 and React 19 support, with the New Architecture enabled by default for all projects. This comprehensive guide provides actionable insights for expert developers working with production Expo applications.

## Latest SDK versions and architectural improvements

The current stable release, **Expo SDK 53**, represents a major architectural shift with **74.6% of projects already using React Native's New Architecture** on EAS Build. The SDK follows a predictable release cadence of three major versions per year, tracking every second React Native release. SDK 54 is planned for late summer 2025 with React Native 0.81 support expected.

Key SDK 53 features include **edge-to-edge Android layouts** (mandatory for Android 16 compliance), the new **expo-audio** module replacing the deprecated expo-av Audio API, and experimental support for **React Server Functions** with EAS Hosting. The New Architecture can be disabled temporarily with `"newArchEnabled": false` in app.json, though this is not recommended for new projects.

Breaking changes developers must address include **React 19 migration issues** requiring resolution configuration in package.json, **Metro ES module resolution** enabled by default (causing issues with @supabase/supabase-js and Firebase packages), and the **removal of push notifications from Expo Go Android**. Node 18 reached EOL on April 30, 2025, requiring an upgrade to Node 20+.

## Development workflow evolution and configuration patterns

Modern Expo development centers around **three configuration approaches**: static app.json for simple setups, dynamic app.config.js for environment variables and conditional logic, and app.config.ts for TypeScript projects with full type safety. The choice depends on project complexity - use app.config.js/ts for any project requiring environment variables or dynamic configuration.

**Development builds have become essential** for production applications, offering custom native library support, push notification testing, and Universal/App Links functionality that Expo Go cannot provide. The migration path is clear: start with Expo Go for learning and prototyping, then transition to development builds when adding libraries not included in Expo Go or when testing production features.

```bash
# Create development build
npx expo install expo-dev-client
eas build --profile development

# Or build locally
npx expo run:ios
npx expo run:android
```

**Continuous Native Generation (CNG)** through the prebuild workflow enables reproducible native project generation from configuration:

```bash
# Generate native directories
npx expo prebuild --clean

# Platform-specific prebuild
npx expo prebuild --platform ios
```

## Expo Router advances to full-stack framework

**Expo Router v5** has evolved into a universal full-stack React framework with file-based routing, API routes, and server-side capabilities. The framework now supports **WinterCG-compliant server endpoints** that can be deployed to EAS Hosting, Vercel, or Netlify.

```typescript
// app/api/hello+api.ts - API Route example
export function GET(request: Request) {
  return Response.json({ hello: 'world' });
}

// app/user/[id].tsx - Dynamic route
import { useLocalSearchParams } from 'expo-router';

export default function UserProfile() {
  const { id } = useLocalSearchParams();
  return <Text>User ID: {id}</Text>;
}
```

**TypeScript support** includes typed routes (beta) with automatic type generation based on file structure, providing compile-time validation and IntelliSense for navigation. Enable with `"experiments": { "typedRoutes": true }` in app.json.

## EAS services provide comprehensive CI/CD capabilities

**EAS Build** supports cloud-based compilation with custom native code, internal distribution, and credential management. Configuration through eas.json enables multiple build profiles:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "development": {
      "developmentClient": true,
      "distribution": "internal",
      "channel": "development"
    },
    "production": {
      "channel": "production",
      "autoIncrement": true
    }
  }
}
```

**EAS Update** enables JavaScript and asset updates without app store submission through a sophisticated channel and branch system. Updates are published to branches and distributed through channels linked to specific builds:

```bash
# Publish update with automatic detection
eas update --auto

# Gradual rollout
eas update --rollout-percentage 25 --channel production
```

**Pricing structure** includes a free tier with 30 builds/month and 1,000 MAUs for updates. Production plans start at $99/month with 50,000 MAUs and higher build quotas. Failed builds that fail quickly (within minutes) are not charged as of May 2024.

## Critical SDK modules and migration patterns

The most important SDK modules have undergone significant changes:

**expo-camera** now features the new `CameraView` component with built-in barcode scanning:

```typescript
import { CameraView, useCameraPermissions } from 'expo-camera';

const [permission, requestPermission] = useCameraPermissions();

<CameraView
  style={styles.camera}
  facing="back"
  onBarcodeScanned={handleBarcodeScanned}
  barcodeScannerSettings={{
    barcodeTypes: ['qr', 'pdf417'],
  }}
/>;
```

**Module-specific permissions** replace the deprecated expo-permissions pattern:

```typescript
// ❌ Old (deprecated)
import * as Permissions from 'expo-permissions';
await Permissions.askAsync(Permissions.CAMERA);

// ✅ New (current)
import { Camera } from 'expo-camera';
const { status } = await Camera.requestCameraPermissionsAsync();
```

**expo-audio** (SDK 53) and **expo-video** replace the deprecated expo-av, while **expo-background-task** supersedes expo-background-fetch. The new **expo-maps** provides iOS 17+ Apple Maps integration as an experimental alternative to react-native-maps.

## Dependency management and monorepo strategies

**Always use `npx expo install`** for Expo and React Native packages to ensure SDK compatibility:

```bash
# Recommended approach
npx expo install react-native-maps expo-camera

# Check and fix version conflicts
npx expo install --check
npx expo install --fix
```

**Monorepo support** is automatic in SDK 52+ for pnpm, earlier for other package managers. Metro configuration requires specific setup:

```javascript
// apps/mobile/metro.config.js
const { getDefaultConfig } = require('expo/metro-config');
const path = require('path');

const projectRoot = __dirname;
const monorepoRoot = path.resolve(projectRoot, '../..');

const config = getDefaultConfig(projectRoot);
config.watchFolders = [monorepoRoot];
config.resolver.nodeModulesPaths = [
  path.resolve(projectRoot, 'node_modules'),
  path.resolve(monorepoRoot, 'node_modules'),
];

module.exports = config;
```

For pnpm compatibility, add `node-linker=hoisted` to .npmrc.

## Performance optimization with modern tools

**Expo Atlas** (SDK 51+) replaces source-map-explorer for bundle analysis:

```bash
# Enable during development
EXPO_UNSTABLE_ATLAS=true expo start

# Production bundle analysis
EXPO_UNSTABLE_ATLAS=true expo export
npx expo-atlas .expo/atlas.jsonl
```

**FlashList v2** provides dramatic performance improvements over FlatList:

- **Performance**: 41.56 FPS vs 9.28 FPS on low-end Android devices
- **Memory**: 4% reduction in RAM consumption
- **Drop-in replacement** with automatic sizing in v2

**Tree shaking** (experimental in SDK 52+) with `EXPO_UNSTABLE_TREE_SHAKING=1` automatically removes platform-specific code and unused imports.

**Image optimization** through expo-image with SDWebImage (iOS) and Glide (Android) provides advanced caching and memory management. WebP format reduces file sizes by 80%.

## Web platform capabilities and PWA support

Expo web apps are **PWAs by default** with automatic manifest generation and service worker compatibility. **React Server Components** (beta) enable server-side rendering with 'use server' directives:

```typescript
// Enable in app.json
{
  "experiments": {
    "reactServerFunctions": true
  }
}
```

**Current limitations** include certain native APIs not translating to web, modal behavior requiring platform-specific styling, and the lack of full production SSR (static rendering only). Use `.web.tsx` file extensions and Platform.OS checks for platform-specific implementations.

**Async routes** in Expo Router enable automatic bundle splitting:

```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "expo-router",
      {
        "asyncRoutes": {
          "web": true,
          "default": "development"
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}
```

## Testing strategies favor Maestro over Detox

**Maestro** has emerged as the recommended E2E testing solution for Expo apps in 2025, offering native EAS Workflows integration and YAML-based test configuration:

```yaml
appId: com.yourapp.id
---
- launchApp
- assertVisible: 'Welcome!'
- tapOn: 'Login Button'
- inputText: 'user@example.com'
- assertVisible: 'Dashboard'
```

**Unit testing** uses jest-expo preset with React Native Testing Library (replacing deprecated react-test-renderer):

```json
{
  "jest": {
    "preset": "jest-expo",
    "transformIgnorePatterns": [
      "node_modules/(?!((jest-)?react-native|@react-native(-community)?)|expo(nent)?|@expo(nent)?/.*|react-navigation|@react-navigation/.*|native-base|react-native-svg)"
    ]
  }
}
```

**React Native DevTools** serves as the primary debugging tool, accessed by pressing 'j' in the terminal after `expo start`, providing console, sources, network, memory, components, and profiler capabilities.

## Critical troubleshooting patterns

Common build failures include **"Gradle daemon disappeared"** (increase heap size), **multiple React installations** (add resolutions to package.json), and **Metro ES module issues** (set `unstable_enablePackageExports: false` in metro.config.js).

For **monorepo issues**, check for multiple React Native versions with `pnpm why --recursive react-native` and ensure proper Metro configuration. **Development vs production differences** can be tested locally with `expo start --no-dev --minify`.

## Third-party integration patterns

**Firebase** offers two approaches: Firebase JS SDK for Expo Go compatibility or React Native Firebase for full feature support in development builds. **Supabase** provides excellent Expo support with AsyncStorage integration:

```javascript
import 'react-native-url-polyfill/auto';
import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js';

export const supabase = createClient(supabaseUrl, supabaseAnonKey, {
  auth: {
    storage: AsyncStorage,
    autoRefreshToken: true,
    persistSession: true,
  },
});
```

**Sentry** migration from sentry-expo to @sentry/react-native is required for SDK 50+. **Stripe** provides official support with config plugin integration. **State management** libraries (Redux, Zustand, MobX) all work seamlessly, with Zustand recommended for smaller projects and Redux Toolkit for complex applications.

## Configuration best practices and patterns

Multi-environment setup through app.config.js enables dynamic configuration:

```javascript
const IS_PROD = process.env.MY_ENVIRONMENT === 'production';

module.exports = ({ config }) => {
  return {
    ...config,
    name: IS_PROD ? 'MyApp' : 'MyApp (Dev)',
    ios: {
      bundleIdentifier: IS_PROD ? 'com.app' : 'com.app.dev',
    },
  };
};
```

**Config plugins** automate native modifications without manual code changes:

```typescript
import { ConfigPlugin, withInfoPlist } from 'expo/config-plugins';

const withCustomPlugin: ConfigPlugin<{ apiKey: string }> = (
  config,
  { apiKey }
) => {
  config = withInfoPlist(config, (config) => {
    config.modResults.API_KEY = apiKey;
    return config;
  });
  return config;
};
```

## Production deployment considerations

For production applications, **always use development builds** rather than Expo Go, enable the **New Architecture** for optimal performance, implement **proper environment variable patterns** with EXPO*PUBLIC* prefix, and leverage **EAS services** for automated builds and updates.

The shift to **edge-to-edge layouts** will be mandatory in SDK 54 for Android 16 compliance. Projects should plan migration from expo-av to expo-audio/expo-video and update Node.js to version 20+ given Node 18's EOL status.

## Conclusion

The Expo ecosystem in 2025 represents a mature, production-ready platform that successfully bridges the gap between rapid development and production requirements. With SDK 53's architectural improvements, comprehensive EAS services, and tools like Expo Atlas and FlashList v2, developers can build performant, cross-platform applications while maintaining excellent developer experience. The clear migration paths and extensive third-party integration support make Expo an optimal choice for both new projects and existing React Native applications seeking modern tooling and workflows.
